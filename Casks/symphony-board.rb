  caveats <<~EOS
    This app is unsigned and not notarized. If macOS blocks launch after install, remove quarantine manually:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Symphony Board.app"
      open "/Applications/Symphony Board.app"

    The thin client requires a running Symphony Board server. Configure the server URL in Settings.
